<p>The goal of the project was to determine where in the IAM study area ecologically, economically and culturally significant areas are located. This was done by identifying relevant and trusted existing data sources that directly relate to the analysis of important areas. <strong>The overlapping datasets were visualized to highlight areas of possible competing interests or concerns</strong>.</p>
<p>Visualizing the results of this analysis can help identify which data are available to decision-makers, denote areas of overlapping demands or concerns, and reveal significant data gaps.</p>

<p>The datasets were chosen by several criteria including availability of geospatial data, coverage of the IAM area and usability of the data in analysis and visualization approach. Altogether the analysis included 20 ecological layers (before 20), 8 economic layers (before 11, mile-layers removed) and 7 cultural layers (before 7).To simplify the visualization in this map, these three groups are divided into 8 categories.</p>
<h4>Ecology</h4>
<ul>

  <li><strong>Fish</strong> (capelin, chum salmon, pink salmon, pacific herring, saffron cod, ESI fish) (6)</li>
  <li><strong>Mammals</strong> (gray whale, bowhead whale, beluga whale, spotted seal, bearded seal, ringed seal, ribbon seal, pacific walrus, polar bear, caribou) (10)</li>
<li>Birds and areas (Murre, IBA) (2)</li>

<h4>Economic</h4>

<li><strong>Transportation</strong> (DOT roads, shipping routes, ports, airports, infrastructure transportation) (5)</li>

<h4>Cultural</h4>
